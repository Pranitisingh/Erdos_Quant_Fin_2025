# Quant Finance Bootcamp Mini Projects

This repository comprises a collection of mini projects covering key topics in quantitative finance, including portfolio optimization, statistical analysis of stock returns, option pricing sensitivities, and delta hedging under stochastic volatility. This project was completed as part of the Erdős Quant Finance Bootcamp Summer 2025 cohort.
## Projects Summary

### Project 1: Risk-Based Portfolio Construction: 
Constructed two potentially profitable investment portfolios—one designed for lower risk and one for higher risk—using historical stock data of:
  
* AAPL: Apple Inc.
* GM: General Motors Co.
* NFLX: Netflix, Inc.
* F: Ford Motor Co.
* ADBE: Adobe Inc.
* TSLA: Tesla, Inc.

### Project 2: Testing Normality for Log-Normal Daily Returns 
Investigated whether the log-returns of selected stocks and the portfolios built in Project 1 are normally distributed by applying the D’Agostino–Pearson test. Most returns did not exhibit normality for the full period, but evidence of normality appeared in certain one-year intervals and after excluding extreme values.

### Project 3: Black-Scholes Call and Put Option Pricing
Calculated and visualized the sensitivities of Black-Scholes call and put option prices with respect to time to maturity (theta) and spot price (delta).

### Project 4: Delta Hedging under Stochastic Volatility  
Simulated stock price paths with stochastic, time-varying volatility using geometric Brownian motion and implemented dynamic delta hedging of short call options. Compared profit and loss distributions under stochastic and constant volatility.
